## Android Form Validator is an easy-to-use library that automates form creation and validation, letting you focus on core app logic.

### Itroduction
The library creates the form and validates details such as username, password, email address, phone number, and more (depending on the developer's settings).

### When using the library, you can:
- Create a simple form by specifying the fields, types, and validation rules.
- Validation: All the validation logic is handled in one place, ensuring clean and organized code.
- Custom Validation: Define custom validation logic by extending the FieldValidator class.
- The library handles automatic error, displaying appropriate error messages when validation fails.
